    <h3>C S 3546 - Introduction to Security Analytics</h3>
    <p>Students will learn about active and proactive security approaches through analyzing logs and security
    datasets. We will cover topics including pipelines of data collection, cleaning, pre-processing, direct and secondary data
    analysis, generating insights, and reporting analysis results for security analysis. We observe various network logs, host
    logs, and Blacklist data to analyze and generate actionable insights that can be automated through designing data
    pipelines. Students will mostly use Python and/or R as the data analysis tools to clean, process, analyze the selected
    datasets, and report the results using simple graph or tabular visualization. A background of python and/or R
    programming would be great but not required. Students will primarily learn about security research questions, security
    threats, threat actors, data management, exploratory data analysis, data visualization (communication), and security
    dashboards. To sum up, the course will motivate students to learn why data-driven security is important and why we need
    to move towards that.
